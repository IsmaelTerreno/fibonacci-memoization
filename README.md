# Fibonacci with memoization programming technique

As developers, you have always asked us from time to time to make an implementation of the Fibonacci process. That's why I decided to upload my version using the programming technique called memoization. The idea of this implementation is to have a cache of results based on the input parameters being this case a case of functional programming where if you enter "A" you will always get "C" therefore if the same parameters were already calculated before the implementation will return the results of the function that were already stored in the results cache. In this way we have the saving of calls to the function to recalculate the result.
